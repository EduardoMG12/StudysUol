# MyFirstApi

Welcome to HYPEFirstAPI! This is my first venture into backend development, and I'm excited to be learning and building at the same time! ðŸ˜Š

## Introduction

This project is aimed at creating a simple backend API using Node.js and Express. As someone with prior experience primarily in frontend development, diving into backend development is a new and exciting challenge for me. With this project, I aim to implement basic functionalities such as a home route, a login route, a registration route, along with corresponding login and registration pages.
